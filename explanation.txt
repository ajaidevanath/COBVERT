1. Create the vector database 

Dataset--Pubmed largest collection of medical articles

csv----title , summary,date of publishing , authors , type of disease,...., link to the pdf or the actual journal

1000 titles ----> embedding technique / Bio-Bert model output the embedding( the size of the embedding for a title 
will typically look like (5,768))

1000,10,768 ----> clustering using k-means  euclidean/cosine/manhattan -----> cluster size can be determined by the elbow plot

5,10,768--->df.iloc[4,:]['journal']---Context

2. Bio-Bert base model training


from csv file take the journals/articles and create a corpus.

all the dataframes and extracting the articles and combining them into one single huge large corpus of only text
corpus = c 

Bio-Bert post trained under 2 techniques

a. ) MLM-masked language modelling

ajai is a great guitarist from bangalore--------------------------------------------[cls][768][768][768][768][768][768][768](7,768)

ajai is a # guitarist # #  ------predict the mask ----probability distribution over the vocabulary( 2 million ---multi class distribution)

import MLM auto trained model for bert from hugging face 
200 odd layers in the BERT , we unfreeze the weights of around 70-80 layers 
c is known ---> pass c through the auto train MLM ----> fix the epoch and other hyperparameters and train the model and save


b.) NSP - Next sentence prediction
import MLM trained earlier and import NSP auto train
The abdominal pain was high and excruciating pain in the lower region. Hence, it was diagnozed as gas attack.
c is known----->chunking and take pairs 1st and 2nd ground truth----> fix the epoch and other hyperparameters and train and save the model

COVID-BERT

3. Question answering 

from BERT import question answering head (start and end vector)

Base BERT model(COVID-BERT) ----> add a question answering head to this model as import from above
model QNA 

Dataset ---Context , Question , Answer 

ajai is a good boy . he lives in bangalore . he has 2 kids .context
question : how many kids does ajai have 
answer 2 kids ......answer start 12 and answer end 14

Dataset SQUAD- Stanford Question and Answerting in context


We will train the QNA model on this question answering dataset called quac
SQUAD - Inherent Flaw , context question 
context, question-----------> model----> answer
context, question2----------> model-----> answer
QUAC - Question answering in context
context and multiple questions
COQA ---Its a multi turn question answering dataset
we will train the QNA on the COQA dataset ---learn the way to answer multiople questions on the same context or article

c1, q ,a
c2,q,a  

c1,q1,a
 c1  ,q2,a
  c1 ,q3,a

covbert_squad_quac_coqa-Final Model


4. Inference modelling 

context, question----Qamodel---answer

question  :how will the above model know which context to take 
question ----Embedding using Bio-Bert model



question: what are the side effects of taking paracetamol
article : "Paracetamol : Effects and uses among children and adults"
article : "Spinal injury: diagnosis and effective contraption techniques of slip disc"

cluster 1              cluster 2           cluster 3 
paracetamol             spinal injury        heart
vrocin                                       sleep 
fever and disprin


Question Embedding----> KNN algorithm apply on the vector database to find the appropriate cluster of importance(cosine/euclidean)

Inside each cluster there may be millions of article titles

Inside the cluster we will run the cosine similarity to check which article title is the closest

from the article title we will retieve the actual article which  will be our context


question, context ------->covbert_squad_quac_coqa-------> answer 



Multi Turn 

Technique 1 
Context, multiple linked questions on the context 



context1: ajai is a good boy . he lives in bangalore . he has 2 kids. His friend Ankit  lives in new delhi
question 1 : how many kids does ajai have 
answer 2 kids




context1 , question
question 2: where does he live?
answer :Bangalore 


context1: ajai is a good boy . he lives in bangalore . he has 2 kids. His friend Ankit  lives in new delhi
question 1 : how many kids does ajai have 
answer 2 kids

question: where does he live?


context1 + question1 + answer 
ajai is a good boy . he lives in bangalore , he graduated in 2011 in mtech PES. he has 2 kids. His friend Ankit  lives in new delhi, he graduated in 2000 from JNU. How many kids does ajai have . 2 kids
cotext_new 

context_new , question2 
where does he live 
answer bangalore 

Technique 2

Follow up questions 

question : hw many kids does ajai have 
question : where does he live
question : does ankit live in new delhi
question : where did ajai do is mtech
question:did he graduate from PES?


De contextualization----un couple the actual context

how many kids does ajai have
where does he live 

Re fromulate second question and put it to the model as "where does ajai live?"

CQR- Context Query Resolution

DATASET available 

context, query and a reformulated query 

Technique 3 

context , question/prompt , answer 
LLM technique (MISTRAL)

second question 

Context, prompt ( is this a follow up question)
"......", prompt("where does he live? is this a follow up question ")
LLM answers yes----> question formulation changing rewrite " where does ajai live'

LLM answer NO it is not a follow up
context, question ---answer
